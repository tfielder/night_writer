#  iteration 2


#count all of the characters from the input message.
#put these characters into an array in chunks of 40.
# iterate through all of these array items.
#  for each character
# miniloop (0..3)
# => write to the newfile @braille_legend[char][count]
# end
# create newline between each array item.


#iteration 3
#create a class called NightReader

#calculate the total number of characters (every 2 columns, every 3 spaces)
#create an appropriate array of size with 3 and then two elements.

#read through the braille.
